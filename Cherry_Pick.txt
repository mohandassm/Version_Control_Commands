Cherry picking in Git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another.

This is in contrast with other ways such as merge and rebase which normally apply many commits onto another branch.

Make sure you are on the branch you want to apply the commit to.

 git switch master
Execute the following:

 git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
 
N.B.:

If you cherry-pick from a public branch, you should consider using

 git cherry-pick -x <commit-hash>
This will generate a standardized commit message. This way, you (and your co-workers) can still keep track of the origin of the commit and may avoid merge conflicts in the future.

If you have notes attached to the commit they do not follow the cherry-pick. To bring them over as well, You have to use:

 git notes copy <from> <to>
